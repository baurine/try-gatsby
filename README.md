# Try Gatsby

Try to learn how to build static blog site by [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), prepare for migrating my blog site to it from Jekyll.

[Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/) is very awesome, it is very easy to follow step by step. Because I am already familiar with React/GraphQL/Next.js before, so it is no much difficult for me to understand the Gatsby.

The only place not very clear for me is that how to reference local asset files (images, docs etc) in markdown file.

After doing some research, I found just "gatsby-remark-copy-linked-files" plugin is enough, or you can choose "gatsby-remark-images" to handle images in markdown file while "gatsby-remark-copy-linked-files" to handle other types files.

A good example to demo use markdown files as content source: [gatsby-example-using-remark](https://using-remark.gatsbyjs.org/)

Some others learned from the tutorial:

- Use Typography.js to customize the style
